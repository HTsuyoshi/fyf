Some cool programs.

For each `F..CK.R` program it will exist a `UNF..CK.R` program.

A little summary for the programs:

* [`blank_space`](./blank_space): Hides a `U+200C` character in some code
    * Programs that can detect:
        * neovim

* [`hydra`](./hydra): A simple window that multiplies
